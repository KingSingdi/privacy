Privacy Policy for HoopRun
Effective Date: January 2, 2026

Introduction
HoopRun ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect from you or that you may provide when you use the HoopRun iOS application (the "App") and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, and disclosing that information.

Information We Collect
1. Personal Information via Apple Sign-In
We use Sign in with Apple to authenticate users. Through this service, we may collect:

Name: To display to other players in your Runs.
Email Address: To create your account. You may choose to hide your email using Apple's "Hide My Email" feature.
Profile Photo: You may optionally upload a profile photo.
2. Location Information
We collect and process your device's Location Data strictly to help you find and schedule basketball runs at nearby courts.

Permission: We only access your location when you are using the App and have explicitly granted permission via the iOS location prompt.
Usage: Location data is used to display maps of courts and verify you are at a run location. We do not track your location in the background or sell your location history.
3. User Content & Payment Handles
We collect information you voluntarily provide to facilitate runs, including:

Run Details: Titles, times, and descriptions of basketball games you organize.
Payment Handles: Venmo, Zelle, or Cash App usernames provided by you for the purpose of receiving payments from other players.
Note: HoopRun does not process payments. We only display the usernames you provide so other users can pay you via third-party apps. We do not store credit card numbers or bank account details.
4. Contacts (Optional)
If you choose to use the "Invite Friends" feature, we may access your Contacts to help you send invitation links via SMS or iMessage. We do not upload your entire contact list to our servers.

How We Store Your Data (iCloud)
HoopRun is built on Apple CloudKit. This means:

Private Storage: Most of your data (Runs, History) is stored in a public database accessible to other App users to facilitate the game, but your private account data is secured by Apple's iCloud infrastructure.
Security: Reliability and security are handled by Apple. We do not maintain a separate private server database of your personal information.
How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect to:

Provide the App's functionality (scheduling runs, managing attendees).
Notify you about changes to your scheduled runs (e.g., specific game cancellations).
Allow other users to identify you as an attendee or organizer.
Data Sharing
With Other Users: Your Display Name, Profile Photo, and Payment Handles (if provided) are visible to other users of the App who view specific Runs you organize or join.
No Third-Party Sales: We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to third parties.
Children's Privacy
Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.
